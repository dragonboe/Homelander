# Homelander - Free Software Directory

A hand-picked collection of free software, apps, and websites I've found useful over the years. The goal here is to help you find reliable tools without spending money on paid alternatives.

## What's Inside?

The directory covers a wide range of categories to help you find what you need:

- **Productivity**: Office suites, note-taking apps, and task management tools
- **Development**: Code editors, version control, and API development tools
- **Graphics & Design**: Image editing, vector graphics, and design software
- **Media**: Video players, streaming tools, and video editing applications
- **Security & Privacy**: VPNs, encrypted email, password managers, and privacy tools
- **Website Scanning**: Tools to check website safety before visiting
- **Communication**: Messaging apps and voice/video chat services
- **Windows Apps on Linux**: Solutions for running Windows applications on Linux
- **Utilities**: File archivers, PDF readers, and system tools
- **Learning**: Online courses and coding tutorials

## Using the Directory

The project is a simple web application that lets you browse through categories and search for specific tools. Just open `index.html` in a web browser to start exploring.

## License

This project is open source, but I'm not accepting contributions right now. The focus is on maintaining a curated list of quality tools rather than growing the collection rapidly.

## About the Project

This directory started as a personal collection of tools I use regularly. I decided to share it in case others find it helpful. The name "Homelander" is just a fun reference - there's no connection to the character from The Boys.
